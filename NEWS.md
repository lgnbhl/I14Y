# I14Y 0.1.5
- new contributor
- added and fixed tests for pull request https://github.com/lgnbhl/I14Y/pull/1
- Modification by pull request https://github.com/lgnbhl/I14Y/pull/1 :
  - Updated all affected functions to use the new backend API base URL.
  - Refactored i14y_search_concept() to align with the new Catalog endpoint, and added support for filtering by conceptValueTypes and registrationStatuses.
  - Added a new function, `i14y_get_dataset_metadata()`, which now retrieves both dataset descriptions and distributions, since these are handled under a unified endpoint in the updated API.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: `i14y_get_data_element()` removed, as its endpoint seems to have been removed in the API.
  - Updated and re-rendered the `README.Rmd` to reflect the API changes and function modifications.
